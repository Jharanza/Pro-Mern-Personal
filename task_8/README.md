<h1>Function Component and Compound Components</h1>

<p>In this project we change all the code in App.jsx to manage the props through a data that will simulate the query to an API or a database</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>The principals changes are:
    <li>All the class components are changed to function components</li>
    <li>The props no longer use React.props.myProps or React.props.children</li>
    <li>We create an Array with the information to pass it to the props. It replace how we will pass information through a database or an API</li>
</ul>
