<h1>Split up the code</h1>

<p>In this project we divide the code between pure html and jsx. Create a file called index.jsx and there put the code from the script in the .html file. In the script tag we connect the html file with the .jsx file with the src</p>

<p>For now, we put the .jsx file and .html file in the same public directory</p>
